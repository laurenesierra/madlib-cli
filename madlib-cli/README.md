## Project Overview

This is a command line application which takes advantage of Python’s built in capabilities for reading and writing files.

Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
Prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
